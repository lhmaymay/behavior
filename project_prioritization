Project prioritization is where you:

align your projects with your strategy
quantify which projects add value and which donâ€™t
balance the volume of projects you take on with you capability to deliver those projects
focus your whole project delivery team on business benefits
In plain English, prioritization is a process where you work out which projects are the most important so that you can focus your resources on successfully delivering those value-added projects.
