Focus on making impact, working on the right things.

“Given all the data we have today, it’s essential that team leaders analyze and extract insights from that data to increase effectiveness. My opinion is that the 
metrics a team focuses on should strongly link to a company’s strategic objectives. In a general sense, I always look at quantity, quality and time. For instance, 
to measure the quality of work, it’s important to look at the number of errors and customer satisfaction. Another thing I measure is employee morale and engagement 
because those can make or break a team.”
