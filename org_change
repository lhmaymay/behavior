adapt to the change and got positive outcome


example: 

re-org, one of the function I managed , key stakeholer moved to another org, and two leads in another squad took parental leave and short handed.
I adapted to the change , re-built relationship with key stakeholders and also stepped in to help to cover the other lead.
In the end, we delivered a lot of high impact projects for both.
