diversity doesn’t just refer to race and gender, but also encompasses categories such as age, sexual orientation, religion, military service, people with disabilities, 
and other traits and experiences that are reflected in a company’s workforce.

We all know by now that biases are all around us. Unfortunately, they can get in the way of even the most well-intentioned hiring team.
In order to minimize bias in my hiring process, I begin by ensuring that the job opening gets broadcast to as many diverse networks as possible.
This helps bring in a diverse range of candidates from the start. Then, I make sure to focus on each candidate’s skills and abilities. To the extent possible,
I ignore gaps in their career history, which might reflect time off to care for children and disadvantage women. I also ignore college pedigree, which is typically
unrelated to performance but can disadvantage people of color. Finally, I use a structured interview process where I make sure to ask every candidate the same questions
so that I’m able to evaluate them on the same set of criteria.

“In my last role, using these strategies over the course of several years allowed me to grow the most diverse department in the organization and it really boosted our 
creativity and performance as a team. We simply did better work with more backgrounds and perspectives represented, exceeding our goals every quarter. Other hiring managers
started asking about what I was doing differently in the hiring process and I was more than happy to share what had worked for me and brainstorm additional ways to eliminate
biases in hiring across the company.”
