quick little self-assessment quiz:

Do you consistently achieve positive results? N
Do you complete tasks assigned to you quickly and efficiently? N
Do you have a history of positive interactions with your fellow employees? N
Speaking of relationships, do you handle conflict professionally? N
Are you a problem solver? Y
Do you take on leadership roles? Y
Are you considered a mentor? Y
Are you considered a leader? Y
Are you a strong communicator? N
Most importantly:

Are you already being viewed as a member of the management team and if offered the position, would you be ready to step up and officially take on that role? N
Now let’s pretend that each of these questions are actually check boxes for your video game character, and every ‘yes’ gets you a green check and every ‘no’ gets you a red x.

Do you have more green checks than red x’s?

If the answer is no, don’t feel bad.  There is no shame in staying where you are and continuing to hone your skills and work towards more green checks.  Better to be overly ready than just overly eager.

If you answered yes, congratulations!  You just unlocked the next section!
