“As a team leader, I aim to build a high performing team, not just a team of superstars. I make sure applicants have the necessary hard skills but also look at important 
soft skills, such as communication, logical thinking, adaptability, attention to detail and reliability. In addition 
to questions to check experience and credentials, I would ask some case study questions during the interview.”
