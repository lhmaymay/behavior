Example:
"I tend to lean towards a democratic leadership style when establishing a new team. After a few months, I become a bit more laissez-faire in my leadership style 
as my employees become more accomplished in their roles. I've found in my past experience that most employees do best when you get out of the way and give them 
the space they need to do their work independently. I'm always present, however, and implement regular check-ins, both formal and informal, to ensure my team has 
all the support and resources they need. 

Knowing a bit about your company culture, I think this approach will work well. The innovative and creativity driven culture fits well with my leadership style."

I create inclusive and diversified work environment for the team. I trust, motivate and empower my team. I don't micro manage people. And I'm a strategic thinker.
I provide clear direction and communicate clearly with my team members about my expectation when I assign tasks to them. Along the way, I make myself available
when they need guidance and help, resources. I built high performing teams, and I like helping people to realize their full potential in my team.
