Sample Answer:
I have over 10 years of experience in DS spanning finance, E-commerce and travel industries.
Over the years, I have built up considerable skills and attributes that have enabled me to become a
competent manager. I am a decisive decision-maker, I have the tools and resources needed to get the
most out of my team, I am a strategic thinker, and I always seek to continually improve and grow within
any managerial role that I occupy. For example, in my last managerial position, I helped the organization

responsibility with being a manager and in the work I do for your company, I will always put your
commercial and financial objectives above everything else.
