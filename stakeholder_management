I took the lead to manage an offshore team to work on population expansion effort,
(1) first step to build a database for previous customers, I hosted a series of weekly meetings with multiple teams include engineering, BI, marketing, product, retention, 
 acquisition and account management etc. Before each meeting I send out meeting agenda, After every meeting, I wrote the meeting minute about progress, next step and challenges,
 and identify key stakeholders for each of the issues.  
(2) I did feature engineering to create some of the key features like identifying their closure reasons, grouping their closure reason into voluntary vs. involuntary. I also got 
inputs and support from multiple teams.
(3) I did competitor analysis on customers closed their accounts on what other products they got.  The product team liked my findings and they started to work on developing the 
right product for them and communicate them with right message, 
(4) I TRIED TO persuade them to do some A/B testing to get some learnings and build a better targeting model for the population. Marketing is worrying about resp rate would be 
too low. So I provided some options (a) Stratified sampling based on the generic targeting model , sample higher % from the top responsive deciles.
